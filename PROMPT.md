# Prompt Engineering for KeyBard CLI

## Execute tasks

Work through the incomplete (unchecked) tasks in @TODO.md . Considering the testing guidance in this file and @README.md and the @test/test-helpers.js . If there are multiple consecutive tasks that apply the same change to a list of files. See if you can create a script to perform the updates to all the relevant files in one shot. If it is not possible to script the changes, complete one task at a time. After completing a task and making sure that all tests are passing (`npm test`), mark it as complete in the /TODO.md file and proceed to the next incomplete task.
