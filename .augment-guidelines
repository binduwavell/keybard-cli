# CLI Command Structure
- User prefers CLI command structure where resource comes first followed by action (e.g., 'combo get' instead of 'get combo') to enable better command grouping with subcommands.

# CLI Testing
- All cli code should be accompanied by corresponding unit tests.
- User prefers testing CLI commands directly with mocks rather than using execSync, as it's more reliable and allows better control over test conditions.
- User prefers that unit tests should use VM sandbox mocking rather than integration tests with execSync.

# Keybard Submodule
- The @keybard/ submodule is read-only and cannot be modified - solutions must work with the existing data structures it provides.

# QMK Settings
- User prefers QMK settings to be displayed and accessed by setting name rather than numeric index for better usability.
